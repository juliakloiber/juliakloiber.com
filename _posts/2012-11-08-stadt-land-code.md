# Stadt Land &lt;Code&gt;

[Stadt Land Code] was Germany's first civic tech incubator. I started the project in 2012 to support civic tech enthusiasts and provide them with visibility and some funding for their projects. We gathered at a barcamp in Berlin and at re:publica conference, to network and spread the idea of tech for the public good. The program attracted many people from accross Germany, many of whom are still part of the civic tech scene. The program helped to prepare the ground for civic tech projects such as [Code for Germany] and the [Prototype Fund].
