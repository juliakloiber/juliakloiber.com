# Superrr Lab

[Superrr Lab] is a feminist think tank and consultancy founded by Elisa Lindinger and Julia Kloiber in 2019. The organization helps public and private entities to develop ethical open and inclusive technology.

The first project of Superrr Lab is a [Feminist Tech Fellowship], supported by the Mozilla Foundation. The fellowship supports women in tech to develop open and inclusive tools and to test new approaches.

Among the first fellows and projects are open-source engineers, a privacy-centric period tracker, and a platform for teaching children about artificial intelligence. The fellowship is part of [Superrr], a community of women in the arts, science, tech, journalism, and activism who challenge the status quo of their industries.

The internet of today is often exclusionary, â€“ Online harassment of women and other minorities is rampant. Unwarranted surveillance of vulnerable groups is routine. And the sophisticated algorithms we interact with every day can have bias in their very code. Further, the internet of tomorrow can look even more bleak: less privacy, less agency, and less control.

The [Feminist Tech Fellowship] empowers people and projects that want a different, better internet. One where safe, equitable participation in the connected world is the norm, and where people of all genders and cultural backgrounds are supported to influence and create tools and concepts for digital interactions.
