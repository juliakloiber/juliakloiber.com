# Request for Optimism

New technologies offer tremendous opportunities to build better futures. Open source and grassroots projects around civic tech, data literacy and software infrastructure are sources of innovation and building communities. This talk will discuss how we can look past bleak sci-fi dystopias and focus on how technology can help improve society.

I gave this talk at the 2018 edition of the [Impakt Festival] in Utrecht.
