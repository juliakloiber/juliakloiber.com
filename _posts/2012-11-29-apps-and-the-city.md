# Apps & the City

[Apps and the City] is a hackathon series with public transport agencies started in Berlin in 2012. 

2012 was the year when the Berlin transport agency published their transport data under an open license. They did so as the first public transport agency in Germany. The inaugural hackathon was a great success and inspired other cities to do the same. I organized a round table meetup and the hackathon â€“ two efforts that led to the open data success.
