# Bitte ein Byte

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published [an article about Open Data and Code for Germany][article] about challenges accessing public data and building applications on top of it.

Tobias Preuss, one of the developer quoted in the article, says that whether he gets access to data or not still very much depends on the assessment of individual public servants. Meanwhile, I point out that transparency does not automatically lead to more equality and how that is too simple of a conclusion for this discussion.
